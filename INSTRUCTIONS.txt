-Setting up the database-
1. On phpMyAdmin, create a new database named 'homefinder'
2. Import 'houses.sql' file
3. Click 'Go'

-Starting up the server
1. Download Developer Exercise zip
2. Extract folder
3. run cmd on developerExercise folder  (app\developerExercise)
4. run the server,type on cmd: php artisan serve
5. view the site on http://localhost:8000/


**NOTE: I tried removing vendor directory as instructed. By doing so, I have encountered this error upon viewing the page;
Fatal error: require(): Failed opening required ... /../vendor/autoload.php
please type the ff line in cmd: composer install
then you may start the server and view the page.

If the program does not start, I can send you the project with vendor folder if needed/requested.

Thank you!
